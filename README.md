## Features

**Home**
- Displays a list of all tasks with real-time filtering by owner, team, tags, project, or status.  
- URL-based filtering (e.g., /tasks?team=development&tags=Urgent).

**Task  Listing**
- Paginated task list with sorting options for completion dates or priority.  
- “Add New Task” button opens a form to create tasks with fields for task name, project, team, owners, tags, time to complete, and status.

**Task  Details**
- View detailed task information, including project, team, owners, tags, time to complete, and status (To Do, In Progress, Completed, Blocked).  
- “Edit Task” button to update task details or status.

**Authentication**
User signup and login with JWT-based authentication, storing tokens in localStorage.  
Protected routes ensure only authenticated users can add, edit, or delete tasks.  
Logout clears the JWT token and redirects to the login page.
